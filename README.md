# Daily_Habits_Analyzer
A habit breakpoint is the moment or condition where a habit breaks.
Many people start habits with motivation but fail to maintain consistency.
The exact moment or condition where a habit breaks—called a habit breakpoint—often goes unnoticed.

This project aims to:

Track daily habit completion

Identify habit breakpoints

Analyze failure reasons and risk patterns

Provide insights to improve habit consistency
